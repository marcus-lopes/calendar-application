# Description

My motivation to start this project is to gain more experience for my career.

## Installation

-Initiation-

When I started this project, I had the intention of creating a calendar for my appointments.

# Usage

![alt text](./CalendarApplication.png)
On this site we have a calendar application, when you enter the current day, month, year and time are given.

Below we have a table with hours from 9am to 5pm, to schedule appointments at these times.

Scheduled the appointment on time, when reloading the page it persists
